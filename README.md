# EASY ROUTER : A PRACTICE PROJECT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE BACKEND  🚀

Easy Router is a simple middleware service that sits between users and Large Language Models (LLMs).  
For now, it integrates with the **Gemini free API**, but it’s designed to support more providers in the future.

## What It Does
- Verifies API keys
- Routes requests to the LLM
- Returns structured responses
- Acts as a centralized AI access layer

## What I Learned
- **Type safety with Elysia** – building strongly-typed APIs
- **Docker containerization** – running the database in containers
- **API key authentication flow** – validating and securing requests
- **Monolithic architecture design** – organizing a scalable backend in a single service

This project helped me better understand backend architecture, authentication systems, and real-world LLM integration.
